/**
 * What a business may have or use on each plan, by plan_master.plan_code. The plan a business is on now is
 * SubscriptionMasterModel::planOfBusiness() (free unless its subscription is active); forPlan() gives its limits.
 * A plan_code with no entry here (a plan staff added later) gets the free plan's limits until one is added, so a new
 * plan never opens more than it should.
 *
 * Caps are the most rows the business may have at once; reaching one refuses the next create, never touches what is
 * there already (a business that moves to a smaller plan keeps its rows, but cannot add more until it is under it):
 * - STORES:    business_store rows of the business
 * - EMPLOYEES: active business_client_link rows of the business, its owners included
 * - PRODUCTS:  artifact_master rows of artifact_type P; 0 means the plan cannot sell products at all
 * - SERVICES:  artifact_master rows of artifact_type S
 * - VARIANTS:  artifact_variant rows of artifact_master
 * - WEBPAGES:  pages of its own design
 * - IMAGE_PER_ARTIFACT: artifact_image rows per 1 artifact_master
 * - IMAGE_PER_WEBPAGE: (future) number of images per 1 webpage
 * Monthly allowances, not caps on rows: how many times a month the business may ask the AI to generate, counted
 * separately for each field it generates into:
 * - AI_CREDIT_TEXT_ATTEMPTS: text generations (a name, a description) per field
 * - AI_CREDIT_IMG_ATTEMPTS:  image generations per field
 * The features are on (true) or off (false):
 * - PRIVATE_SESSION_BOOKING: a customer books a service session for themself alone
 * - SESSION_REGISTRATION:    the business opens a session (a class) and customers register to join it
